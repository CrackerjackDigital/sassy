# SASSY for SilverStripe

sassy is a dynamic sass compiler which transforms sass (scss) files into css at request time. 

If no changes are detected then it will pull from cache instead. 

This is usefull while development iterating though isn't too big a perf hit in live mode it's probably
better to check the transformed css into your source control and link to that.

## Configuration

By default sassy will listen on /sassy/ for requests for a file.
